INTRODUCTION
------------

Thank you for downloading my hud! This hud changes the standard Fortress Forever in-game UI to fit the more practical, minimalistic, and/or competitive player. All in-game onscreen elements have been stripped of their large backgrounds. Number values for health, armor, ammo, and grenades have been moved to the bottom-center of the screen, and have been simplified into plain white text with a black outline to ensure clarity. Other minor changes include the removal of some unneeded icons, font changes, and other hud element movements.

This Release enlarge scores, killfeed, game timer, and shrinks map name.
It also changes HudChat to work for 16:10 resolutions.
